# Mashup project

This project is open-ended!  Requirements:

* Build a site that uses data from at least one external API in an interesting way.
* Replace this README with a description of the project.

In other words, the JS code should be **non-trivial**.  That being said... start simple!  No server-side coding is required, but feel free to create a backend in whatever language if you like, if you need one.

* [list of API suggestions](https://gist.github.com/afeld/4952991)
* [inspiration?](http://www.programmableweb.com/mashups)

## V1

First pass.

## V2

Iterate!

* Refactor
* Add a new feature

## Bonus points

* automated tests
    * [Sinon.js fakeServer](http://sinonjs.org/docs/#fakeServer) may be helpful
* fancy interactivity/animations
